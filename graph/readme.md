# Graph
Similar to a tree except a lot more crazy. Node can be connected to as many nodes as it needs. Each node is considered a vertex and the connections it has with other nodes is considered an edge.


### complexity
| Operation     | Best Case |
|---------------|-----------|
| Add Vertex    | O(|V|^2)  |
| Add Edge      | O(1)      |
| Remove Edge   | O(1)      |
| Remove Vertex | O(|V|)^2  |
